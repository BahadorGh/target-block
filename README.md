4. Create new file in your project. for example: `index.js`
5.Use the `target-block` package into your codes like this:

const RPC_URL = "https://singapore.rpc.blxrbdn.com";
const howManyConfirmations = 5;

waitForTargetBlock(howManyConfirmations, RPC_URL)
.then((result) => {
    console.log("Target block reached:", result);

<b>Main motivation behind target-block</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
I was trying to verify my contract programatically on Sepolia testnet. When I supposed to <span style='color:green'>deploy and verify smart contract</span> on block explorers(such as etherscan.io) I noted that, <span style='color:red'>we can't do both  at the same time!</span><br/><br/>
<b>So how to figure it out??<br/>
How to wait for a certain block heigth??</b><br/><br/>
Easily with the help of <i style='color: red;'>target-block package!!</i>
